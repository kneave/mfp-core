MacFeegle Prime - Core
==

This repo contains code related to all the core on-robot ROS scripts for [PiWars](www.piwars.org) entry MacFeegle Prime!  The CAD models and controller code will be added to separate repos in the future.

This robot is inspired by Johnny 5 from the Short Circuit movies.  It runs on a [StereoPi](www.stereopi.com) board which hosts a [Raspberry Pi](www.raspberrypi.org) Compute Module.  The software stack used is [ROS](www.ros.org), the Noetic release.

For more info on the progress of the robot have a look at my [blog](https://neave.engineering/category/piwars/) and my [YouTube Channel](www.youtube.com/neaveeng).
